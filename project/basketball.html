        <h2>Knicks Gear Up for Playoff Push</h2>

        <p>How does the roster look today?<br>
            The Knicks are one of the league’s most unchanged teams. They bring back eight of their nine rotation players from last season. The one change is signing former Golden State Warriors guard Donte DiVincenzo to a four-year, $47 million contract. To free up money for him, they traded Obi Toppin to the Indiana Pacers for two second-round picks. Otherwise, the offseason was quiet. Josh Hart picked up a player option for the 2023-24 season and then agreed to a four-year extension that will keep him under contract through 2028. The starting lineup that turned into the best of the Tom Thibodeau era (Jalen Brunson, Quentin Grimes, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson) remains intact.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Rising Stars: Brooklyn Nets' Phenoms</h2>
        <img src="../images/OLThumbnail_ATLDec6.avif" alt="Brooklyn Nets" width="300" height="200">
        <p>The Nets finally get their clean slate following the failed Durant years, and luckily have both a solid head start and no incentive to lose. We should see a kind of repeat of 2018-19, when Brooklyn clawed its way back into the postseason with a scrappy, fun roster after years of rebuilding. This team likely isn’t good enough to avoid the play-in tournament, and could very well get eliminated there. But if Claxton makes an All-Defensive team, Bridges is a surefire All-Star, and Simmons looks revitalized, it shouldn’t matter in the big picture.</p>
