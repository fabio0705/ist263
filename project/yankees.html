        <h2>Yankees Secure Big Time Free Agent Signing</h2>

        <p>It has been a while since the Yankees were the big, bad team of Major League Baseball. Gone are the days where every top free agent was a lock to be headed to New York with the Steinbrenner family winning the bidding wars. And it's now been 14 years since the last time the Yankees won a World Series. New York is looking to change all that. It might not have signed a big free agent, but it did land the biggest name on the trade market this offseason, completing a deal for Padres outfielder Juan Soto on Wednesday. Landing Soto is a massive move for the Yankees. The team has lacked left-handed sluggers in recent years, and has not had the necessary lineup support behind 2022 AL MVP Aaron Judge. In acquiring Soto, the Yankees are not only adding another MVP candidate, but one who bats left-handed and is fully capable of taking advantage of the short porch in right field at Yankee Stadium.  </p>

        <p>David Stearns is ready to hit the ground running in his first season as Mets president of baseball operations.

            With the Mets coming off a 74-87 season, Stearns has a full agenda to try and help the team get back to the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. That checklist includes hiring a new manager, filling the coaching staff, and assessing which players will remain to try and make that push.</p>
