        "Hello! My name is Fabio Candelario and I’m a junior attending Syracuse University majoring in Information Management Technology. I grew up in Washington Heights, NY and I’m the oldest of 3 brothers I’ve always been good with numbers, and working in data analytics has been a personal goal of mine ever since my internship last summer. During my internship, there were various occasions in which I had to think critically to complete the task at hand, while also being the utility player of my team (I don’t know if you watch baseball, but it means I played a ‘jack of all trades’ role for my duration there). I’m also very involved on my campus as I’m part of Lambda Alpha Upsilon Fraternity, SHPE, MCI, and DSA. Although I’m proud of my professional side, that’s not all I do! I enjoy adventuring, finding new food places, watching new films, and watching/playing sports."
