        <h1>Fabio Candelario's Biography</h1>

        <p>Hello! My name is Fabio Candelario and I’m a junior attending Syracuse University majoring in Information Management Technology. I grew up in Washington Heights, NY and I’m the oldest of 3 brothers. <strong>I’ve always been good with numbers</strong>, and working in data analytics has been a personal goal of mine ever since my internship last summer. During my internship, there were various occasions in which I had to think critically to complete the task at hand, while also being the utility player of my team (I don’t know if you watch baseball, but it means I played a ‘jack of all trades’ role for my duration there). I’m also very involved on my campus as I’m part of Lambda Alpha Upsilon Fraternity Incorporated, SHPE, MCI, and DSA. </p>  
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Although I’m proud of my professional side, that’s not all I do! I enjoy adventuring, finding new food places, watching new films, and watching/playing sports.</p>
